# QR-Code Generator
This is a simple QR-Code Generator with a GUI made with Python and "tkinter", created for a school project.

## Installation
Unzip the folder to your preferred location and make sure "kalo.ico" and "placeholder.png" are located in the directory of execution. Right now the best way to use the program is to open it in an editor, install all the required modules and run it since the .exe file has no certificate and is therefore flagged as a virus.

## Important notice
Every generated image gets stored and may be reviewed by a developer. There is a disclaimer which you'll have to accept in order to use the program. If you do not wish your images being stored or reviewed, you may use "-nosend-" before your text/link (no space before/after the command).
